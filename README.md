A collection of scripts for simple bioinformatic tasks

Please submit your favourite one liners. Feel free to include these scripts
in your own projects. 

Most tools use only standard linux tools `bash`, `grep`, `awk` and `perl`.

Files do not have extensions, so implementations can be changed without changing command names. Some files scripts call other scripts in this repo.
